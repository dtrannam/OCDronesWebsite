The webpages should be presentable as a whole; the interface should be user friendly (text should be easy to read).
The website should contain pictures and/or videos, and they should be presentable as well (placed in a proper place, easy to see, have proper size and resolution).
Website has 1 homepage and at least 3 subpages; the homepage and subpages have a horizontal menu that leads to the other pages. This means 4 total pages will be required.
The homepage has picture carousel animation (slideshow effect, for example, pictures in this page http://oregonstateparks.org/ (Links to an external site.)). This needs to autoscroll and have forward and back buttons.
Have a scroll box in one page. You can put text only or text with pictures inside the scroll box.  The scroll box should have something like a scroll bar to allow users rolling it up and down. Some students have scroll boxes show up after submitting the form, if this is the case make sure you add a comment to the grading TA letting them know.
One page has a form either submit via get or post (enter the email and subscribe, a short survey, etc.)  You can set it to be submitted to http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~zhangluy/tools/class-content/form_tests/check_request.phpLinks to an external site. or your own link as long as it is working. Forms that do not actually transmit the data somewhere will not receive full marks.
One page has unordered HTML list with several entries. The horizontal menu does not count for this requirement.
There is one button to download files (map to the farm, menu in the restaurant, a personal CV, etc.) The downloaded file can either open in the browser or download to the local computer.
There is a link that you can click and leads to outside webpages (LinkedIn, Yelp, email, etc.)
You are allowed to add other features not listed above to your website as long as they are functional and serve some purpose in your website.
You should use at least HTML/CSS and JavaScript in your project.
